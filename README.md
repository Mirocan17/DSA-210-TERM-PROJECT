Do Tanking NBA Teams Really Get What They Want? Exploring the Draft Dreams and Realities Behind Losing Seasons 
## Project Overview
Every NBA season, certain teams lose their games on purpose, sacrificing wins today for the hope of future superstar. This debatable strategy, popularly known as tanking, leads to a very important question with two opposite opinions among fans: Do tanking NBA teams really get what they want? 

In this project, we will explore whether sacrificing a teams entire season for the draft worths or not. We will analyze NBA regular season data and NBA draft data including team records, draft results and player performances for each NBA year. We will also try to understand that whether that lottery system is just or not.

## Motivation
Every summer, different from most of the other popular sports in the world, more than 50 new young and talented basketball players comes to the NBA. Especially top picks of those drafts are destined to change the destiny of the league and their franchises. Some succeeds but some of them are just lost after couple of years. In the draft lottery, all of the least successful teams and some mid block teams have chance to get top 3 picks with different percentages. Some teams has no choice other than tanking due to the lack of talent in their squad but some teams do it on purpose because of the generational talents in the draft. Even if its logical to get a generational talent for the franchises future, losing games on purpose is dissapointing for the fans and there is no guarantee that the team will get what they want. Also, i have been following NBA right now for around 7 years and most of the contending teams didnt change a lot so i really want to learn do tanking really change destinies of franchises.
