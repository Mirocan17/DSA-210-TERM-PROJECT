Do Tanking NBA Teams Really Get What They Want? Exploring the Draft Dreams and Realities Behind Losing Seasons 
## Project Overview
Every NBA season, certain teams lose their games on purpose, sacrificing wins today for the hope of future superstar. This debatable strategy, popularly known as tanking, leads to a very important question with two opposite opinions among fans: Do tanking NBA teams really get what they want? 

In this project, we will explore whether sacrificing a teams entire season for the draft worths or not. We will analyze NBA regular season data and NBA draft data including team records, draft results and player performances for each NBA year. We will also try to understand that whether that lottery system is just or not.

## Motivation
Every summer, different from most of the other popular sports in the world, more than 50 new young and talented basketball players comes to the NBA. Especially top picks of those drafts are destined to change the destiny of the league and their franchises. I want to investigate how many of these players are truly changing the destiny of their franchises and what skills do they have. I also wanted to learn that how many of these tanking teams get the pick that they want in the draft. Another thing i want to explore is the justice in that lottery system because it changes throughout years.
